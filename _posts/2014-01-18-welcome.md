title: Rewriting ASCIIFlow
---
Nearly 3 years ago I developed ASCIIFlow. This was my first foray into github, and my first significant project outside of University or Google. It was one of my most valuable experiences as a developer and surprisingly, the site was a big hit!

The time eventually came and I realized a re-write was in order.
ASCIIFlow 1.0 has many issues, here are the major ones:
- Inability to re-size and move shapes/lines.
- No mobile support.
- Insecure storage.
- Limited diagram sizes.

These are all solvable problems, most of them trivially so, except perhaps for the first!
